            Redo some of my very medicore College Projects? <br>
            Maybe or no because I want to do some thing cool. :) <br>
            <br>
            Gotta Get some data about lotto players. <br>
            The whole way lottos work is very interesting <br>
            Where the money comes from is where it goes is extremely interesting! <br>

            <br>
            <br>

            Consumer Sentiment/Confidence is also very interesting! <br>
            Think! <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Consumer Confidence Index</li>
                <li>Recession?</li>
                <li>Analysis with Regards to presidents?</li>
            </ul>
            But I think this is less interesting. <br>
